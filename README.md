f2j-mode
========

Emacs major mode for editing f2j source code

## Installation

Clone the project:

    $ git clone https://github.com/zhiyuanshi/f2j-mode.git

Add the directory to your `load-path` and require the library.

    (add-to-list 'load-path "#{Path to your just-cloned directory}")
    (require 'f2j-mode)

And you're good to go! F2J mode will be automatically turned on for `.sf` files.

## TODO

1. Add indentation feature
2. Add basic interaction with `f2j` command and options
